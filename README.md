BASIC RUBY PROJECT

PROJECT 4 : Bubble Sort

Assignment

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

--- 
Remarks : Not optimised, method go through the array N-1 times (with N the length of the array).
